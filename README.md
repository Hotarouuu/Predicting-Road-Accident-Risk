# Kaggle Competition - Predicting Road Accident Risk

## Introduction

In thie Kaggle Playground Competition, the objective was "Predict the likelihood of accidents on different types of roads.". It was a simple problem, but main focus in Kaggle Competitions is to reach the best accuracy, which in this competition is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
In this repository, I will present my solution that achieved an RMSE of 0.05567. Unfortunately, I didn't win the competition, but I would like to share my line of thinking and possible improvements for future competitions.
